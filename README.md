# Shinobi-Assassin
A final project for my Python class (CIST 2742) that runs a game using the Pygame module

Created in Python 3.X

Steps to get the game to play.
1. Unpack maps, sounds, and sprites
2. Ensure the pygame module is installed on your computer
3. run the __main python file
4. Have fun


The music in this game was replaced by silence due to size/ copyright constraints

The project runs off several python objects all workign together.
The game loop runs off of the Ninjagame Singleton.
The game data is stored and ran off off the Game Controller Singleton.

Something to note, there was some planned methods in the game that were removed from the current version
That code is still visible, but has been commented out.
